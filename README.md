# Navmesh AI Tutorial 39 - Changing from Animated NavMeshAgents to Ragdoll NavMeshAgents on Death

Learn how to transform your fully animated NavMeshAgents and transform them into a Ragdoll on death that eventually subtly fade out! This is a great way to add more "game feel" into your game with more responsive, physically based death behaviors for your NavMeshAgents.
